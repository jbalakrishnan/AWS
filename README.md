Sage code for the 2020 Arizona Winter School course 
"Computational tools for quadratic Chabauty"

To compute double Coleman integrals and local p-adic heights on hyperelliptic curves, replace the following Sage library files with the files in this repository and rebuild Sage:

* src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padics.py
* src/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_generic.py
* src/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_padic_field.py
